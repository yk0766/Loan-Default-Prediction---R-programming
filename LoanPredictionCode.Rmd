<font > 25 Percentile of loans give less than 8.9% interest rate. Median of the interest rate of all loans in 11.99%. The interest rate can go as high as 28.99 % in some case.The interest rate when higher can be a high risk loan. This interest seems really active to invest in.

```
<font>The default rate percentage increases from Grade A to H. Average Payments are more than average average loan amount in each grade. Yes these numbers surprise us-> when compare the returns of the different grade with NASDAQ for last 16 years (2007-2022 Current Year) which yields about 16.7 percent average - there are some grades which are not able to beat the market. Considering both NASDAQ and P2P market are highly volatile and even further risks in P2P we would expect them to give more average returns. If we had to invest in only one grade - depending on the risk apetite we would have chosen # grade C. Although it has a low average interest rate compared to other higher risk grades(D,E,F), it has an average interest rate of 14% which is sufficient to double the money in 5 years time. </font>


<font> The loan amount varies from 400 to 38,000. Most number of loans are of the amount approximately 12,000$. Most Grade G loans are of lesser amounts. he number of charged off loans are less in overall number, and it is evident in the graph # Both these distribution seem to be left skewed. In an ideal case these would have been normally distributed.There are loans which are higher than 30,000 and still paid.Also, there are loans of less than 10,000 and charged off </font>



<font> We can see that the average interest rate is higher in higher grades of loans. Intuitively we might be more interested in higher rates, however they come with 
trade off higher risk. The graph shows that the interest rate varies from 0-28. Most number of loans ~13-14% interest rate. Trend of interest rate with grade - Lower Grade corresponds to lower interest rate. Intutivetly, we should prefer a lower grade loan if both grades give same interest rate. The most common loan is grade B loan with a ~13% interest</font>

#### Outliers Analysis 
```{r}

#Look at the variable summaries -- focus on a subset of the variables of interest in your analyses & modeling


#lcdf %>% select_if(is.numeric) %>% summary() 

# Let us look at the outliers in loan amount -  

ggplot(lcdf, aes( x = loan_amnt)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill=grade)) + 
xlab("Loan Amount ") + ylab("Grades of Each Loan  ") + theme(plot.title = element_text(color="#993333", size=14, face="bold.italic"), axis.title.x = element_text(color="#993333", size=14, face="bold"), axis.title.y = element_text(color="#993333", size=14, face="bold")) 


# Let us look at the annual income 

ggplot(lcdf, aes( x = annual_inc)) +  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), colour="black", fill="white")+ geom_density(alpha=.2, fill="#FF6666") +  ggtitle("Distribution of Number of Loans With Annual Income ") + xlab("Annual Income ") + ylab("Number of Loans  ") + theme(plot.title = element_text(color="#993333", size=14, face="bold.italic"), axis.title.x = element_text(color="#993333", size=14, face="bold"), axis.title.y = element_text(color="#993333", size=14, face="bold")) 


# Let us check how are these very high income associated with loans status 

ggplot(lcdf, aes( x = annual_inc, y=loan_status)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill=loan_status)) +  ggtitle("Distribution of Number of Loans With Annual Income By Loan Status - Before Removing Extreme Outliers") + xlab("Annual Income ") +  theme(plot.title = element_text(color="#993333", size=14, face="bold.italic"), axis.title.x = element_text(color="#993333", size=14, face="bold"), axis.title.y = element_text(color="#993333", size=14, face="bold")) 

```
<font> Yes, there are outliers. However to remove them we should check the frequency and also see the business use case  these outliers might be justified given the fact that loan amount can vary. </font>

<font> For annual income the data seems to really skewed towards the left, very few loans have the income more than 1.5 Milliion. A person coming to lending club for loan with income more than 1.5 million might be suspicious. It is logical to think about why would a person need a loan with 1.5 million income. Hence we will remove thes 9 observation. We could alternatively assignment a maximum value, since we have 110k data point we can remove 9 rows </font>

<font> The very high income cases are for paid-off loans. # We can exclude them, however we do so we might not have a decision tree model which predicts the hypothesis that high income people pay off the loan in most cases.Going with the use case we will discard and keep them in a separate dataframe.We shall observe what difeerence it makes to out models in the later part. Compared to the 110k data size the number looks really small, hence we will remove these </font>

#### Removing the outliers for annual income 
```{r}

## Chunk 12 <For knitting of .rmd file>


lcdf <- lcdf %>% filter(annual_inc <= 1500000)

# Let us look at the new distribution of annual income after outlier removal 

ggplot(lcdf, aes( x = annual_inc, y=loan_status)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill=loan_status)) +  ggtitle("Distribution of Number of Loans With Annual Income By Loan Status - After Removing Extreme Outliers ") + xlab("Annual Income ") +  theme(plot.title = element_text(color="#993333", size=14, face="bold.italic"), axis.title.x = element_text(color="#993333", size=14, face="bold"), axis.title.y = element_text(color="#993333", size=14, face="bold")) 

```

<font>The plot looks much cleaner, and inference can be drawn from the the above as we have removed those outliers.We might argue to the fact that data still has outliers, but removing the ones above 1.5 IQR now we might lose essential information. However this was the case when we removed observations above 1.5 million, but they were just 9 observations in the 109k observations.</font>

#### Revol util 

<font> Ratio of current balance/ high credit limit. </font>

```{r}
### Chunk 13 

ggplot(lcdf, aes( x = revol_util)) + geom_boxplot() +  ggtitle("Distribution of Revol Util ") + xlab("Revol Util") +  theme(plot.title = element_text(color="#993333", size=14, face="bold.italic"), axis.title.x = element_text(color="#993333", size=14, face="bold"), axis.title.y = element_text(color="#993333", size=14, face="bold")) 

# Identified outliers by boxplot 
out_ru <- boxplot(lcdf$revol_util, plot=FALSE)$out
#Let us look at these examples 
out_ru_i <-which(lcdf$revol_util %in% out_ru)
lcdf[out_ru_i,] 

# We will remove these 9 outliers 

lcdf <- lcdf [-out_ru_i, ]

```

#### Recoveries and Total Payment Analysis 

```{r}
# Recoveries - post a loan charged off gross amount recovered
 # Checking if recoveries are only for charged off loans 
 
lcdf %>% group_by(loan_status) %>%summarise(Rec=sum(recoveries))  


lcdf %>% group_by(loan_status) %>%summarise(Sum_Rec=sum(recoveries), TotPmnt=sum(total_pymnt), total_rec_prncp=sum(total_rec_prncp), total_rec_int=sum(total_rec_int), total_rec_late_fee=sum(total_rec_late_fee))

```


<font> Hence recoveries are only for charged off loans, this also goes with the general idea of recovery of credit for any loan  it will only be for the charged off if it has to be there. Sometimes recovery might not be present for the charged off loans as well. This is the case where there has been a loss. </font>

<font> he way to calulate recovered amount in terms of charged loans ='total_pymnt'= 'total_rec_prncp'+'total_rec_int'+'total_rec_late_fee'+'recoveries' </font>

#### Actual Return 

```{r}
# Let us look at some columns 

lcdf %>% select(loan_status, int_rate, funded_amnt, total_pymnt) %>% head()

# We will use the following to calculate annualized return 
#annReturn = [(Total Payment  - funded amount)/funded amount]*12/36*100

lcdf$annRet <- ((lcdf$total_pymnt -lcdf$funded_amnt)/lcdf$funded_amnt)*(12/36)*100

# Returns for charged off and fully paid loans 
lcdf  %>% group_by(loan_status) %>% summarise(avgRet=mean(annRet), stdRet=sd(annRet), minRet=min(annRet), maxRet=max(annRet))

# Do charged off loans have negative returns - 

lcdf %>% select(loan_status, int_rate, funded_amnt, total_pymnt, annRet) %>% filter(annRet < 0) %>% count(loan_status)

```

<font> What is surprising here is the  fact that the avg return rate differ significantly fro average interest rate . The minimum return rate for some loans which are fully paid can go as minimum as 0.  </font> <font size=4> This might be because some loans which are paid off are paid off earlier than the expected date.</font> 


#### Returns from loans - Fully Paid and Charged off 

```{r}

## Chunk 16
# Fully Paid 


lcdf %>% filter( loan_status == "Fully Paid") %>% group_by(grade) %>% summarise(nLoans=n(),  avgInterest= mean(int_rate), avgLoanAmt=mean(loan_amnt), avgPmnt=mean(total_pymnt), avgRet=mean(annRet),  minRet=min(annRet), maxRet=max(annRet))

lcdf$actualTerm <- ifelse(lcdf$loan_status=="Fully Paid", as.duration(lcdf$issue_d  %--% lcdf$last_pymnt_d)/dyears(1), 3)

# We know using simple interest Total =  principle + pnr/100
# Hence r = (Total - principle)/principle * 100/n

# Then, considering this actual term, the actual annual return is

lcdf$actualReturn <- ifelse(lcdf$actualTerm>0, ((lcdf$total_pymnt -lcdf$funded_amnt)/lcdf$funded_amnt)*(1/lcdf$actualTerm)*100, 0)

# For cost-based performance, we may want to see the average interest rate, and the average of proportion of loan amount paid back, grouped by loan_status

lcdf%>% group_by(loan_status) %>% summarise(  meanintRate=mean(int_rate), meanRet=mean((total_pymnt-funded_amnt)/funded_amnt),meanRetPer=mean((total_pymnt-funded_amnt)/funded_amnt)*100, sumTotalpymt = sum(total_pymnt), sumFundedamnt = sum(funded_amnt), term=mean(actualTerm)  )

lcdf %>% group_by(loan_status) %>% summarise(avgInt=mean(int_rate), avgRet=mean(actualReturn),avgTerm=mean(actualTerm))

```
<font>We also observe the actual term for loan is not 3 years in case of fully paid loans. Indeed some loans are fully paid earlier than 3 years.</font>
<font># Charged off loans are expected to have negative return irrespective of the grade. Higher graded have higher loss / negative mean return rate. But the distribution of the return is only between -0.36 - -0.466 in case of charged off loans.In case of fully paid loans, higher grades give higher average return. The range of return is higher 0.09 to 0.349.
We would want our investor to get the best returns and minimize losses at the same time.</font>

<font> More than half (58 %) of loans were taken for debt consolidation. This follows the the Pareto principle of 80:20 rule, as the top 3 puposes are more than 80% of loan purposes.mall business has higher default percentage. Loan borrowed for smaller business is defaulted the most in terms of percentage.It is also indicative of the fact that borrowers are coming to lending club for small business as they might have been already declined for a loan by bank.he loans show a very similar pattern irrespective of the purpose. Most number of loans in B for some cases , C followed by A grade loans. People with 10 + years of experience are the most common borrower of loan for credit card and debt consolidation. Home improvement loans are more common with 10+ years of experience.car loans are more common with people having 2 years of experience. Which might be reflective of the fact that once people are in job for 2 years they would want to keep a car for which they come to the lending club. We can see that home improvement loans were not the all with those owning the house. This might be because they were doing home improvement in rented house. Also more than 60% home were mortgaged. Also it can happen i might not directly own the house, owned by the partner while person borrowing the loan is doing home improvement over it.We can see the distribution of loan amount by various purposes.We can see that small business loans have significant distribution, fairly wide spred. Implying scales might be diffeerent for the small business.  </font>

<font>Yes, assigned loan grade varies, significantly with the borrower history. We can also check the min, max median in the below box plot </font>


#### Converting character variables 
```{r}

#glimpse(lcdf)

#  there are a few character type variables - grade, sub_grade, verification_status,....
#   We can  convert all of these to factor

lcdf <- lcdf %>% mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)

#Checking the datatype after conversion 

#glimpse(lcdf)


```


#### Leakage variables 
<font>
Concept of leakage - In statistics and machine learning, leakage (also known as data leakage or target leakage) is the use of information in the model training process which would not be expected to be available at prediction time, causing the predictive scores (metrics) to overestimate the model's utility when run in a production environment.Reference - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leakage_(machine_learning)#:~:text=In%20statistics%20and%20machine%20learning,when%20run%20in%20a%20production</font>

```{r}
#Identified the variables you want to remove

varsToRemove = c('funded_amnt_inv', 'term', 'emp_title', 'pymnt_plan', 'earliest_cr_line', 'title', 'zip_code', 'addr_state', 'out_prncp', 'out_prncp_inv', 'total_pymnt_inv', 'total_rec_prncp', 'total_rec_int', 'total_rec_late_fee', 'recoveries', 'collection_recovery_fee', 'last_credit_pull_d', 'policy_code', 'disbursement_method', 'debt_settlement_flag',  'settlement_term', 'application_type')

lcdf <- lcdf %>% select(-all_of(varsToRemove))  

#Drop all the variables with names starting with "hardship" -- as they can cause leakage, unknown at the time when the loan was given.

#First checking before dropping

lcdf %>% select(starts_with("hardship")) 
# Dropping 

lcdf <- lcdf %>% select(-starts_with("hardship"))

#similarly, all variable starting with "settlement", these are happening after disbursement 

lcdf %>% select(starts_with('settlement'))

# 4 columns 

#Dropping them

lcdf <- lcdf %>% select(-starts_with("settlement"))

# Additional Leakage variables - based on our understanding 


varsToRemove2 <- c("last_pymnt_d", "last_pymnt_amnt", "issue_d",'next_pymnt_d', 'deferral_term', 'payment_plan_start_date', 'debt_settlement_flag_date'  )


# last_pymnt_d, last_pymnt_amnt, next_pymnt_d, deferral_term, payment_plan_start_date, debt_settlement_flag_date  

lcdf <- lcdf %>% select(-all_of(varsToRemove2))


```
<font> Understanding the leakage is very important in the concept of Data Mining where we will be going ahead to predict models based on the training data. The models will be well trained if we use the leakage variable, however when we get unseen set of data the prediction will be poor as they wont be having values of these variables</font>

#### Missing Values 

<font>Potential reasons for missing values in different variables?
Are some of the missing values actually 'zeros' which are not recorded in the data?
Is missing-ness informative in some way?  Are there, for example,  more/less defaults for cases where values on the attribute are missing ? </font>

```{r}
# Dropping columns with all n/a

lcdf %>% select_if(function(x){  all(is.na(x)) } ) # Checking what are those columns 

lcdf <- lcdf %>% select_if(function(x){ ! all(is.na(x)) } ) # Dropping

# Finding names of columns which has atleast 1 missing values 


names(lcdf)[colSums(is.na(lcdf)) > 0] 

# Finding proportion 

options(scipen=999) # To not use scientific notation 

colMeans(is.na(lcdf))[colMeans(is.na(lcdf))>0] 


# Finding the columns which have more than 60% missing values 

names(lcdf)[colMeans(is.na(lcdf))>0.6]
nm<-names(lcdf)[colMeans(is.na(lcdf))>0.6]
lcdf <- lcdf %>% select(-all_of(nm))

#Impute missing values for remaining variables which have missing values
# - first get the columns with missing values

colMeans(is.na(lcdf))[colMeans(is.na(lcdf))>0]
nm<- names(lcdf)[colSums(is.na(lcdf))>0]

summary(lcdf[, nm])

# Replacing values - adding median values 

lcdf<- lcdf %>% replace_na(list(mths_since_last_delinq=median(lcdf$mths_since_last_delinq, na.rm=TRUE), bc_open_to_buy=median(lcdf$bc_open_to_buy, na.rm=TRUE), mo_sin_old_il_acct=median(lcdf$mo_sin_old_il_acct,na.rm=TRUE), mths_since_recent_bc=median(lcdf$mths_since_recent_bc, na.rm=TRUE), mths_since_recent_inq=5, num_tl_120dpd_2m = median(lcdf$num_tl_120dpd_2m, na.rm=TRUE),percent_bc_gt_75 = median(lcdf$percent_bc_gt_75, na.rm=TRUE), bc_util=median(lcdf$bc_util, na.rm=TRUE) ))



lcdf<- lcdf %>% mutate_if(is.numeric,  ~ifelse(is.na(.x), median(.x, na.rm = TRUE), .x))


dim(lcdf) 
```

<font>Yes, some columns have same percentage of missing values. This could be because they are dependent columns. Information source of a column is also the source of other columns could be the reason. These missing values can be because of the following - 1. Missing Completely at Random 2. Missing at Random 3. Missing Not At Random. We could use various techniques taught in class to impute these missing values. 1. Imputing values 2. Leaving those rows. However approach for each column can be different. We could use various techniques taught in class to impute these missing values. 1. Imputing values 2. Leaving those rows. However approach for each column can be different. If they do not relate well to larger values, than we should not assume that missings are for values higher than the max.We will remove columns with more than 60% missing values, this is taken as a trial and test way - However when it comes to removing columns with NA approach could be different in each case. This could also mean loss of very important variable. We can tune our model based on the results
 </font>


#### Univariate Analysis - AUC

<font> which variables are individually predictive of the outcome ?
Considering a single variable model to predict loan_status, what could be a measure of performance?  AUC? For a univariate model with a variable, say, x1, what should we consider as the model 'score' for predicting loan_status? Can we take the values of x1 as the score for a model y_hat=f(x1) ? Using this approximate approach, we can then compute the AUC for each variable. AUC of a classifier is equivalent to the probability that the classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative instance.Reference - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7695228/ </font>

```{r}
#We will use the function auc(response, prediction) which returns the AUC value for the specified predictor variable, and considering the response variable as the dependent. 


aucAll<- sapply(lcdf %>% mutate_if(is.factor, as.numeric) %>% select_if(is.numeric), auc, response=lcdf$loan_status) 


library(broom)

tidy(aucAll[aucAll > 0.5])

tidy(aucAll) %>% arrange(desc(aucAll))


```


<font>Example, actualReturn, actualTerm are in the data - we have kept these because they will be useful for evaluating performance of models. 
  High AUC effect on model It tells how much the model is capable of distinguishing between classes. Higher the AUC, the better the model is at predicting 0 classes as 0 and 1 classes as 1. By analogy, the Higher the AUC, the better the model is at distinguishing between patients with the disease and no disease. Will need to make sure these are not included in building the models </font>
  
  
#### Building the model - Splitting the data into Train and Test

<font> Defining train and test Train Data set: Used to fit the machine learning model.
Test Data set: Used to evaluate the fit machine learning model.While there are no set rules to define the proportion of test and train data - the split should be enough to train the model well to predict well on the unseen data. So we could try various splits and check how the model performs. Our aim throughout is good generalization. Reference - https://machinelearningmastery.com/train-test-split-for-evaluating-machine-learning-algorithms/</font>

```{r}


## set the seed to make your partition reproducible
set.seed(123)

TRNPROP = 0.5  #proportion of examples in the training sample



nr<-nrow(lcdf)

nr

trnIndex<- sample(1:nr, size = round(TRNPROP * nr), replace=FALSE)

lcdfTrn <- lcdf[trnIndex, ] # Train data 

lcdfTst <- lcdf[-trnIndex, ] # Test data 



```

#### Decision Tree Model - 

```{r}
# Variables for the modelling 

# No we dont want to use all the variable - we will remove the leakage variables we found in the AUC combined table 

#  Variables like actualTerm, actualReturn, annRet, total_pymnt will be useful in performance assessment, but should not be used in building the model.


varsOmit <- c('actualTerm', 'actualReturn', 'annRet', 'total_pymnt')  

# Checking if target variable is factor

class(lcdf$loan_status)

# Converting it to factor where Fully paid is target 

lcdf$loan_status <- factor(lcdf$loan_status, levels=c("Fully Paid", "Charged Off"))

# Decision Tree - Model

lcDT1 <- rpart(loan_status ~., data=lcdfTrn %>% select(-all_of(varsOmit)), method="class", parms = list(split = "information"), control = rpart.control(minsplit = 30))

printcp(lcDT1)


```
<font>The complexity parameter (CP)is not the error in that particular node. It is the amount by which splitting that node improved the relative error. So in your example, splitting the original root node dropped the relative error from 1.0 to 0.5, so the CP of the root node is 0.5. The CP of the next node is only 0.01 (which is the default limit for deciding when to consider splits). So splitting that node only resulted in an improvement of 0.01, so the tree building stopped there.</font>

#### Changing cp, minimum split

```{r}

lcDT1 <- rpart(loan_status ~., data=lcdfTrn %>% select(-all_of(varsOmit)), method="class", parms = list(split = "information"), control = rpart.control(cp=0.0001, minsplit = 50))


#check for performance with different cp levels

printcp(lcDT1)

lcDT1$variable.importance %>% head(10) 

```

#### Pruning the tree based on different cp values - 0.0015, 0.0002, 0.0003

<font>We will now prune the tree to see the performance, this pruning will be based on different cp values </font>

```{r}

# We will change values of cp to see different models 


lcDT1p1<- prune.rpart(lcDT1, cp=0.0015) 

printcp(lcDT1p1)

lcDT1p1$variable.importance %>%head(10)


lcDT1p2<- prune.rpart(lcDT1, cp=0.0002) 

printcp(lcDT1p2)

lcDT1p2$variable.importance %>%head(10)


lcDT1p3<- prune.rpart(lcDT1, cp=0.0003) 

printcp(lcDT1p3)

lcDT1p3$variable.importance %>%head(10)

```



#### Model based on more balanced dataset 

<font>Using the 'prior' parameters to account for unbalanced training data. The 'prior' parameter can be used to specify the distribution of examples across classes.  By default, the prior is taken from the dataset</font>

```{r}

#Training the model considering a more balanced training dataset?


lcDT1b <- rpart(loan_status ~., data=lcdfTrn %>% select(-all_of(varsOmit)), 
               method="class", parms = list(split = "gini", prior=c(0.5, 0.5)), 
               control = rpart.control(cp=0.0, minsplit = 20, minbucket = 10, maxdepth = 20,  xval=10) )


printcp(lcDT1b)



lcDT1b$variable.importance %>% head(10)



# Pruning the balanced tree 



lcDT1bp<- prune.rpart(lcDT1b, cp=0.001301) 


printcp(lcDT1bp)


lcDT1bp$variable.importance %>% head(10)

plot(lcDT1bp)

```
<font> We had a dataset which was first split into 50:50. We created a model changed the cost parameter.Then we pruned the tree with different values of cp. We also created a balanced model, later pruned the tree. </font>

#### Evalution of the model 

```{r}

# Using the predict function, training data set  




confusionM <- function(models, data) {
  
  predTrn=predict(models,data, type='class')
  tab1 = table(predicted = predTrn, true=data$loan_status)
  print(mean(predTrn == data$loan_status))
  return(tab1)
}

```

#### Threshold - 0.3 from 0.5 - For all the above models 

<font> We qualified all the results above 0.5 towards charged off, we will now change the threshold to a lower value. This change is based towards our goal towards detecting Charged Off Loans well.

#### C50 Decision Tree Model 

<font>This algorithm uses an information entropy computation to determine the best rule that splits the data, at that node, into purer classes by minimizing the computed entropy value. This means that as each node splits the data, based on the rule at that node, each subset of data split by the rule will contain less diversity of classes and will, eventually, contain only one class [complete purity]. This process is simple to compute and therefore C50 runs quickly. C50 is robust. It can work with both numeric or categorical data [this example shows both types]. It can also tolerate missing data values. The output from the R implementation can be either a decision tree or a rule set. The output model can be used to assign [predict] a class to new unclassified data items.

<font> Our aim was to find features we should consider while making investment decision, while we started with 150+ variables, we analyzed each variable and its relation with the target variable - loan status. There are several factors to be considered - The actual return may vary from the interest shown. There are certain factors like loan grade, sub grade which are really important based on our analysis. Let us look at metric and decide as per our use case 

1.	Accuracy – While accuracy is important in defining how well a model is performing, we have a class imbalance problem which makes accuracy not a good measure of model performance. However, we can balance the class by oversampling and rely on this metric. Since we want to correctly predict Fully Paid loans for getting the return and correctly predict Charged off loans so as to minimize the risk of losing the money – we will check further parameters with accuracy. 
2.	Precision – This seems a good metric when we accurately want to predict charged off loans since we want to be very sure of our prediction. 
3.	Recall – What proportion of actual positives are is correctly classified -  in our case with charged off loans we want to capture as many charged off loans as possible – if we want to minimize the risk.

While we would want to maxize two things at once – there is a precision recall tradeoff - 

Reference: https://towardsdatascience.com/the-5-classification-evaluation-metrics-you-must-know-aa97784ff226
Since we are investing with an idea of minimizing the loss we will take the following text confusion matrix obtained by the model 


Based on our analysis, we would get an annual return of 5.5% by investing in lower risk loans – which our model predicts as Fully Paid with a accuracy of 65%. This is the return that can be expected when investing in the loan. The potential loss is -12% annually based on our calculation. The loss encompasses the return we will lose in safer investment options like CD, Savings account which provide a ~2% annual return. Hence reiterating our goal of minimizing loss while maintaining a reasonable rate of return. 

For example an investment of 100 dollar should have returned 116.5 dollar at 5.5% return, but we have observed the loans are repaid by the end of 2nd year. Hence our return would be lower – We assume that the money received is added to other investment option like CD, Savings account in the last one year (which could potentially give a return of 2%), hence actual return after 3 years 113.2$. 

Based on the recovery percentage X and the model – We might have a 5% chance of falsely predicting a charged off loan as fully paid. Hence, the investor might lose his money when investing in loans. However, we have seen that there X% recoveries of charged off loans, hence entire amount will not be lost. However had the same amount been deposited in alternative investment like CD, Savings account for 3 years (which could potentially give a return of 2%), hence actual return after 3 years 106$ for a 100$ investment.  This would be the actual loss calculation. Also one of the reasons we have been concentrating on minimizing the loss while making reasonable return. 
The following shows C5 rules and Random Forest weighted model is predicting well for our case of study based on the cost matrix we created. 

Tuning the cost matrix will give different results and different best models. Selection can depend on use case.

## Assignment 2 - Using GBM 
 
```{r}


# gbm: Generalized Boosted Regression Modeling (GBM)

# Since the bernoulli distribution in GBM requires the distribution to be [0,1] we will convert our Charged Off and Fully paid loan status in that format. 

# Let us check the values of loan status in 5 columns 

lcdf$loan_status[10:15]

# Let us use unclass to bring it in the required format 

unclass(lcdf$loan_status)[10:15]

# It shows fully paid as one and charged off as 2 

unclass(lcdf$loan_status)[10:15]-1

# Therefore the format we wanted is achieved.

# Distribution - Bernoulli as its a classification problem 

# Number of Trees - If Lambda/Shrinkage value is small more trees will be needed 

# Shrinkage Value - 0.01-0.001 Number trees for 0.001 is 10 time 0.01. However smaller shrinkage will give improved performance. 

# Interaction Depth 

# How to get optimal number of iterations ? 1. Independent Test Set 2. OOB Estimate 3. Cross Validation 


# Lets check the results of the GBM 

# Lower Lambda will make it slower. 

# Depth increase might give overfit, still overfit might be less than random forest Also added time
